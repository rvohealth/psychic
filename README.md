> ATTENTION: we are currently in the process of releasing this code to the world, as of the afternoon of March 10th, 2025. This notice will be removed, and the version of this repo will be bumped to 1.0.0, once all of the repos have been migrated to the new spaces and we can verify that it is all working. This is anticipated to take 1 day.

# Psychic

Psychic is a typescript first Node framework built on top of [kysely](http://kysely.dev) and heavily inspired by Ruby on Rails. It provides a light-weight routing layer around [expressjs](https://expressjs.com) to create a familiar MVC pattern for those coming from a conventional MVC framework, a type-safe ORM with an incredibly powerful autocomplete API, elegant redis and socket.io bindings for distributed websocket applications, the ability to couple with a front-end framework (like react, angular, etc...) and write specs that drive through your front end, while still maintaining a back end-centric context from which to write specs.

For more comprehensive documentation, please see [The official Psychic guides](https://psychic-docs.netlify.app). We will also be publishing api docs shortly, but the Psychic guides should be comprehensive enough to provide an understanding of the technology and how to use it.

NOTE: doing so will create the new app in the psychic folder, so once done testing remember to remove it.
