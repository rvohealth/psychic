# Psychic

Psychic is a typescript first Node framework built on top of [kysely](http://kysely.dev) and heavily inspired by Ruby on Rails. It provides a light-weight routing layer around [expressjs](https://expressjs.com) to create a familiar MVC pattern for those coming from a conventional MVC framework, and...

Introducing [dream](https://psychicframework.com/docs/models/overview)!, a robust, type-safe ORM with an incredibly powerful autocomplete API, through associations, polymorphism, single table inheritence, deep OpenAPI integration, and much more.

In addition, psychic also provides elegant redis and socket.io bindings for distributed websocket applications, a powerful background job system integrated with bullmq to enable you to easily send any of your application code into redis for background processing, the ability to couple with a front-end framework (like nextjs, react, angular etc...) and write specs that drive through your front end, while still maintaining a back end-centric context from which to compose, and much more!

For more comprehensive documentation, please see [The official Psychic guides](https://psychicframework.com). We will also be publishing api docs shortly, but the Psychic guides should be comprehensive enough to provide an understanding of the technology and how to use it.
