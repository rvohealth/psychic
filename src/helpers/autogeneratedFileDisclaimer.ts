This file was automatically generated by my cat, Aster.
He does not want you mucking about with his files,
and we are pretty lax on trimming his nails.

I mean, we have him pretty well fenced in but he is an
escape artist and he still manages to get fleas!

My point is, don't go mucking about with his files!

He actually has a hopefully well-tempered message for
us humans, he says:

"
  Dear pathetic humans,

  Here is a haiku to keep you in line

  don't dare go mucking
  with my files, I lyke them fine
  prettierignore
"
